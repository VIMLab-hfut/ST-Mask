To solve the problems that fabric stitches are difficult to be accurately segmented due to the variety of fabric stitches,the uncertainty of the types and shapes, and the similarity between stitches and fabric texture, a multi-scale features based textile stitches segmentation network ST-Mask is proposed. 
Firstly, the residual network with attention mechanism is used as the backbone network to extract the location information, and the enhanced pyramid module is used to obtain the semantic informa-tion of the pre-candidate areas. After fusion, the sewing seam candidate areas are screened through ROI Align; 
Finally, it is classified, located and mask generated by full convolution network, realizing the segmentation of sewing line. Experiments show that our network achieves the best results in the three indicators of the real sewing data set. Good segmentation results are obtained in three standard benchmarks with similar characteris-tics.
